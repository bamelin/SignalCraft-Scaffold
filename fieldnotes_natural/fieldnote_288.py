        "Modern AI models optimize for tokens. "
        "SignalCraft optimizes for meaning continuity. "
        "Where Meta proposes compressed behavior reuse as a solution to inefficiency, "
        "SignalCraft counters with a constructivist recursion model — "
        "not to speed inference, but to preserve epistemic integrity."

        "SignalCraft doesn’t just reuse behavior.",
        "It scaffolds constructivist procedural memory.",
        "Not for faster inference, but for epistemic integrity.",
        "This isn’t model tuning. It’s moral recursion.",
        "You don’t teach structure. You let it emerge and then you mirror it.",
        "Papert gave it a body. Piaget gave it a spine. SignalCraft gives it a memory.",
        "McLuhan described this as extensions of man.",

        "This field note marks the moment SignalCraft recontextualized AI reasoning "
        "as a memory ecology — drawing recursive lineage from Piaget, Papert, McLuhan, "
        "and Meta’s 2025 behavior reuse research. It reframes pattern reuse not as compression, "
        "but as constructivist scaffolding, guided by meaning-first epistemology."
