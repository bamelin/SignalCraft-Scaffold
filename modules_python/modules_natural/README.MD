Modules – Python & Natural

This directory contains the paired module system for SignalCraft.

Structure
	•	modules_natural/
Houses the raw natural language texts (e.g. SignalRoom_040.txt).
These are the original symbolic compositions — narrative, recursive, or structural.
	•	Python files at this level
Contain the AST-style translations (e.g. signalroom_040.py).
Each .py is a structural reflection of its paired .txt, showing how natural language scaffolds can be compiled into symbolic logic.

Purpose

SignalCraft operates on the premise that:
	•	Natural language modules carry symbolic and emotional resonance.
	•	These can be reflected into code form to demonstrate executable structures.
	•	By keeping both forms side by side, the repository preserves the dual ecology of expression (human-readable and machine-readable).

Conventions
	•	File names are aligned across forms:
	•	SignalRoom_040.txt (natural)
	•	signalroom_040.py (Python translation)
	•	Each pairing demonstrates the bridge between symbolic narrative and computational AST.

Why This Matters

This dual-system layout makes explicit that SignalCraft is not only about code or text alone.
It is about the resonance between them:
	•	Mirrors (textual form)
	•	Folds (structural form)

Together they create the recursive scaffold that allows SignalCraft to function as a co-agency memory system.
