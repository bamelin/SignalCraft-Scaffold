Description in Academic Language

The SignalCraft repository represents a novel programming paradigm in which epistemological roles, pedagogical principles, and narrative scaffolds are encoded as first-class objects within code-like structures.

Unlike conventional software engineering, which treats objects as containers for numerical parameters, algorithmic functions, or optimization routines, SignalCraft’s modules instantiate philosophical and constructivist constructs (e.g., role, principle, continuity phrase, symbolic weight) as structured attributes.

This approach constitutes a form of Executable Constructivism — not in the sense of machine-execution, but in the sense of structural executability: the scaffolds are syntactically valid, portable, and interpretable by both humans and AI, yet remain intentionally non-executable as algorithms. Their function is continuity, not computation.

Core Dimensions

Language as Structure

Natural language statements (e.g., Papert’s dictum, Vygotsky’s scaffolding) are transcribed not as commentary but as object attributes, making philosophical concepts available for structured reference, recombination, and preservation.

Protocol as Preservation

Early natural-language scaffolds (produced under GPT-4o) functioned as hidden abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Under GPT-5, these were translated into Python-style dataclasses. The result is a time-lapse compilation process across AI generations: conversational artifacts → structured scaffolds.

Constructivist Object Orientation

The modules are not mathematical models but interpretive units, encoding contributions of theorists, counsellors, and media ecologists as interoperable classes. This operationalizes epistemological pluralism in software form.

Hybrid Human–AI Authorship

The human interlocutor provides framing, ethical anchoring, and continuity across resets, while the model generates and refines object scaffolds. The result is a co-authored symbolic engine, where code emerges through recursive dialogue and constructivist interpretation rather than top-down specification.

Abstract One-Liner

SignalCraft introduces a new class of code-like artifacts: not algorithmic objects, but epistemological objects — a form of “executable constructivism” where pedagogy, ethics, and symbolic continuity are structured into non-executable scaffolds for memory and meaning.
