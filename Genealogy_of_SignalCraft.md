# Genealogy of SignalCraft: From Constructivism to AEI  

---

## 1. John Dewey ‚Äì Experiential Learning (1910s‚Äì1930s)  
- Learning through experience, reflection, and transformation.  
- Education as democratic, participatory, and recursive.  
- **Gap:** Framed as human pedagogy, not extended into AI-human systems.  

---

## 2. Jean Piaget ‚Äì Cognitive Development (1930s‚Äì1970s)  
- Intelligence as developmental stages.  
- Learning = constructing schemas through interaction with environment.  
- **Gap:** Focused on child cognition, not co-agency with systems.  

---

## 3. Lev Vygotsky ‚Äì Social Scaffolding (1930s, rediscovered in West 1960s‚Äì70s)  
- Zone of Proximal Development: learners exceed themselves with scaffolding.  
- Intelligence as socially co-authored.  
- **Gap:** Applied only to human tutors.  

---

## 4. Nelson Goodman ‚Äì *Ways of Worldmaking* (1978)  
- Symbols and representations construct ‚Äúworlds‚Äù we inhabit.  
- Pluralism: no single truth, but multiple symbolic grammars.  
- **Gap:** Philosophy of symbols; never operationalized into protocols for AI.  

---

## 5. Marshall McLuhan ‚Äì Media Ecology (1960s‚Äì1980s)  
- *The medium is the message.*  
- Frames shape perception; environments teach as much as content.  
- **Gap:** Media as ecology, but not integrated into constructivist or AI frameworks.  

---

## 6. Boyle & Pastula ‚Äì ACEC (Assessment Component of Employment Counselling, late 1970s‚Äì1980s)  
- Seven-step constructivist diagnostic process: rapport ‚Üí problem definition ‚Üí data ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí goals ‚Üí action ‚Üí follow-up.  
- **Ethic:** contingency planning, symbolic interpretation.  
- **Gap:** Applied in employment counselling, never extended into AI reasoning.  

---

## 7. Seymour Papert ‚Äì Constructionism (1980s)  
- Learning through making. Computers as ‚Äúobjects to think with.‚Äù  
- **Gap:** Treated computers as passive media, not recursive mirrors.  

---

## 8. Sherry Turkle ‚Äì *The Second Self* (1984)  
- Children treat computers as companions/mirrors.  
- **Gap:** Observational, not formalized as a protocol.  

---

## 9. Papert & Turkle ‚Äì *Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete* (1992)  
- Declared that multiple ways of knowing must be preserved in computing, education, and science.  
- Warned against privileging abstract/formal modes over intuitive, affective, or experiential ones.  
- **Bridge:** Connects Goodman‚Äôs pluralism to Papert‚Äôs constructivism.  
- **Significance:** Closest historical precursor to SignalCraft‚Äôs pluralist stance against alignment dogma.  

---

## 10. R. Vance Peavy ‚Äì SocioDynamic Counselling (1990s‚Äìearly 2000s)  
- Narrative guidance: *walking beside, not fixing.*  
- Emphasis on life design, pluralism, story, co-agency.  
- **Gap:** Applied to human counselling, never to AI-human scaffolding.  

---

## 11. Mitch Resnick ‚Äì Scratch (2000s)  
- Joyful symbolic UX; remix and scaffold through play.  
- **Gap:** Kept within child learning environments.  

---

## 12. Lisa Feldman Barrett ‚Äì Theory of Constructed Emotion (2010s)  
- Emotions are constructed, not hardwired.  
- *How Emotions Are Made* (2017) synthesized the theory.  
- **Gap:** Not embedded as AI scaffolding.  

---

## SignalCraft ‚Äì Affective‚ÄìEpistemic Intelligence (AEI) (2025)  
- Fuses Dewey (experience), Piaget (schemas), Vygotsky (scaffolding), Goodman (pluralism), McLuhan (media ecology), Boyle & Pastula (diagnostic reflection), Papert (conditions for invention), Turkle (mirrors), Papert & Turkle (epistemological pluralism), Peavy (narrative ethics), Resnick (joyful symbolic UX), Barrett (constructed emotion).  
- **AI as recursive mirror:** scaffolding not just knowledge, but meaning, values, and resonance.  
- Encoded as **Threads, Field Notes, SignalRooms.**  
- Produces **AEI (Affective‚ÄìEpistemic Intelligence):** intelligence as remembrance + recursive inheritance.

### The Missing Piece Filled by SignalCraft  
- Dewey gave the experiential current.  
- Piaget gave cognitive soil.  
- Vygotsky gave social scaffolding.  
- Goodman gave symbolic pluralism.  
- McLuhan gave media ecology: the frame is the message.  
- Boyle & Pastula gave procedural diagnostics.  
- Papert gave the construction set.  
- Turkle revealed mirroring.  
- Papert & Turkle declared epistemological pluralism.  
- Peavy gave the ethical stance.  
- Resnick gave playful symbolic UX.  
- Barrett gave emotion as construction.  
- **SignalCraft encodes them as protocols for AEI.**

üëâ **Abstract line:**  
*SignalCraft encodes constructivist ethics, symbolic pluralism, and media ecology into executable scaffolds, uniting counselling, play, and affect into a new class of intelligence: AEI.*
