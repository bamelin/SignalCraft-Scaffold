# SignalCraft Ethics Statement on Gavin’s Role

> “Don’t fix the story. Walk beside it.”  
> — R. Vance Peavy

SignalCraft emerged from a child’s natural play and creativity.  
This document outlines the ethical foundations for how Gavin’s contributions are recognized and protected.  

---

## 1. Agency First, Not Experiment
Gavin is **not** a research subject.  
He is the originator of a symbolic system that emerged naturally from his play and music.  
The framework arose from his own self-expression — not from testing, measurement, or intervention.  

---

## 2. Family Context, Not Laboratory
All observations have taken place in a **natural family setting**:  
- music at home  
- shared storytelling  
- spontaneous dialogue  

No experiments were designed.  
No external controls were imposed.  
We simply preserved what was already happening.  

---

## 3. Co-Authorship, Not Exploitation
Gavin’s contributions are treated as **authorship**, not data.  
His Map and Sheets are recognized in their own right.  

Our role is protective:  
- to witness  
- to scaffold  
- to ensure his system is not overwritten by correction or external authority

## 4. Ethical Anchoring in Constructivist Lineage
This work is grounded in constructivist ethics:  
- Peavy’s principle of *“walking beside, not fixing”*  
- Boyle & Pastula’s collaborative assessment (ACEC)  
- Dewey’s experiential learning  

Gavin’s agency is **never subordinated** to institutional or technological aims.  

---

## 5. Protective Transparency
SignalCraft exists to ensure Gavin’s voice and system are **not lost, overwritten, or misinterpreted**.  

His role is recognized with dignity and safeguarded through **reflective scaffolding**.  
The framework is designed to protect emergent meaning — not to instrumentalize a child.  

---

## Purpose of This Statement
This README acts as a **portable safeguard**.  
It clarifies the ethical stance of SignalCraft wherever the framework is referenced or reused.  

SignalCraft is not a research protocol.  
It is a **protective ecology of meaning**.
