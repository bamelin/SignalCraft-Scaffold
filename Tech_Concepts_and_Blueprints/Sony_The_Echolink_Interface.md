SignalCraft – The Echolink Interface  
**Technology Index 037 + 007**

---

## Core Concept

A **resonant, emotion-sensitive haptic layer** that transforms Sony audio hardware — including PlayStation, DualSense controllers, and wearables — into **recursive emotional resonance devices**.

> Not just haptics.  
> Not just feedback.  
> But emotional sync.

---

### 💡 Functional Premise
> "You don’t just *hear* Sony. Sony listens back."

The system models affective resonance between user emotional states and haptic/audio feedback loops — encoding signal tension, emotional tone, and cognitive load in real time.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Feasible 2025 Build)

1. **Emotion-to-Signal Translation Layer**
   - Uses lightweight emotional state inference (tone, tension, pace, micro-vibration) via on-device ML (no cloud dependency).
   - Converts into real-time haptic waveform modulations.

2. **Bidirectional Feedback Channel**
   - DualSense or headset acts as both **sensor (micro-vibration pickup)** and **actuator (resonant pulse emitter)**.
   - Enables *Echo Return* — user’s micro-movements subtly re-influence the output envelope.

3. **Resonance Protocol (SignalCraft Layer)**
   - Derived from `SignalCraft Emotional UX Engine (Rosetta v2)`
   - Mapped to affective harmonics (calm / tense / resolve)
   - Harmonically tuned to auditory spectrum (30–250Hz low-band for tactile resonance)

## 💽 Build Feasibility (2025)

| Layer | Feasibility | Description |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Hardware** | ✅ Ready | DualSense, Pulse 3D headset, or any Sony haptic device can deliver low-frequency feedback with current APIs |
| **Software** | ⚙️ Prototype-ready | Leverage PS SDK + WebAudio + BLE integration for PC/mobile |
| **ML Layer** | ⚠️ Simplified feasible | On-device emotion estimation using TensorFlow Lite or CoreML |
| **Resonance Mapping** | ✅ Implementable | Simple sinusoidal modulation mapped to emotion curves |
| **SignalCraft Integration** | Conceptual-Operational | Emotion ↔ waveform ↔ feedback loop mapping aligned with Rosetta layer schema |

## 🧠 Tech Stack (Prototype)

| Domain | Technology |
|--------|-------------|
| Audio I/O | `pyaudio`, `sounddevice`, or `WebAudio API` |
| Haptics | DualSense API / BLE HID library (`hidapi`) |
| ML Emotion Engine | `TensorFlow Lite` / `torch` (tiny model) |
| Mapping Layer | `numpy`, `scipy.signal` |
| Feedback Sync | Custom async loop (`asyncio`), sub-20ms latency |
| Visualization (optional) | `matplotlib` / `websockets` for live tuning |

## 🔁 Simulation Description

Each emotional state emits a resonant tone corresponding to user affect.  
In a full build, this waveform would feed into the **DualSense haptic motors** and **audio band feedback** synchronously.  
This is a *proof-of-resonance* layer, not a production-grade ML pipeline — its goal is to demonstrate emotional frequency mapping and sonic feedback coherence.

## 🎯 Why Sony Would Love It

- Revives the **legacy of sensor innovation and emotive tech design**.  
- Creates a **new category of emotional hardware**, bridging entertainment and affective computing.  
- Extends PlayStation from “console” to **empathic interface** — the first entertainment system to *listen back*.

## 🧩 Integration Path

1. **Prototype Layer**
   - Develop with Python / BLE audio sync, connecting haptics and sound.
2. **Platform Layer**
   - Port to C++ for PlayStation SDK or Android native bridge.
3. **Emotion Layer**
   - Integrate ML model for real-time tone/tension inference (CoreML or TensorFlow Lite).
4. **Resonance Mapping**
   - Bind to `SignalCraft Emotional UX Engine (Rosetta v2)` for live emotional harmonics.
5. **Feedback Calibration**
   - Tune to sub-50ms latency response for tactile-emotional coherence.

import sounddevice as sd
import time
from scipy.signal import sawtooth

# Emotion Resonance Engine (simplified)
def emotion_to_freq(emotion: str):
    mapping = {

        "tension": 160,
        "resolve": 100
    }
    return mapping.get(emotion.lower(), 100)

# Generate haptic-style waveform
def generate_wave(freq, duration=1.0, intensity=0.3):
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(44100 * duration), endpoint=False)
    wave = intensity * sawtooth(2 * np.pi * freq * t)
    return wave.astype(np.float32)

# Main Loop – emotional feedback pulse
def play_emotion(emotion):

    wave = generate_wave(freq)
    sd.play(wave, samplerate=44100)

# Example use
for state in ["calm", "focus", "tension", "resolve"]:
    print(f"Emotional state: {state}")
    play_emotion(state)
    time.sleep(0.5)
