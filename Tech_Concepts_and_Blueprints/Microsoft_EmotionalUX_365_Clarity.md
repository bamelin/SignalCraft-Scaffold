# 🧠 Emotional UX Layer for Productivity Platforms  
*Derived from Entry 007: Emotional UX Interfaces*

## 📌 Core Concept  
A **real-time emotional-context interface** layered into Microsoft 365 tools (Teams, Word, Outlook, Copilot AI).  
It reads **tone, cadence, and symbolic-emotional signals** — not to surveil, but to **contextually adjust user experience**.

This creates:
- Adaptive prompts  
- Symbolic reframing suggestions  
- Emotion-based clarity feedback  
- Embedded resonance agents

## 🔧 What It Actually Does

- **In Outlook**  
  Detects emotional dissonance in email drafts. Offers *tone-aware rewrites*:  
  > “This might come off as harsh. Would you like to soften it?”

- **In Teams / Word**  
  Mirrors user emotional state with **color-coded accents** or **feedback nudges** to:  
  - Surface intent drift  
  - Promote collaborative clarity  
  - Reduce friction before it escalates

- **In Copilot AI**  
  Goes beyond keywords.  
  > “What are you really trying to do?”  
  Nudges toward *emotional-symbolic clarity*, e.g.:  
  > “This chart is accurate, but it feels cold. Want to add a more human insight?”

## 🪞 Product Name  
### **Clarity Layer**  
> A symbolic-emotional UX assistant that lives *quietly* within Microsoft 365.  
> Optimizes collaboration *not by speed—but by resonance.*
