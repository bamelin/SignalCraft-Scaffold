SignalCraft Registry + Portable Memory Demonstration
----------------------------------------------------
File: signalcraft_registry_portable_block_001_030.py

Purpose:
Combines the first thirty remembered technologies from the
SignalCraft Technology Index with a live proof that
"Meaning survives outside state."

When executed:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Builds the full registry of remembered technologies.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exports memory to a portable JSON file.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Clears local memory (simulated amnesia).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Reloads from JSON and confirms identical structure.

Interpretation:
The system forgets, yet the pattern reappears exactly as before‚Äî
a live proof of constructivist continuity.
